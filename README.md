# Predicting MLB Games
Chai-team: Toby, Devarsh, Harsh

Most of main does preprocessing. Models are run at the end at the ====== Train Models ========= section (line 136)

The season, (2023, 2022 or 2021) can be changed on lines 15 and 16. Simply change the csv string to match the desired date for both pitcher and batter datasets.

That's about it. There were three different approaches to the preprocessing and we had to start over each time, but finally, we got it where it needed to be. Adding more columns/features would be an interesting task for another day. Maybe the OBP or the slugging metrics would be better predictors for win rate, like mentioned in Denali's presentation on Moneyball, but that is a task for another day.
